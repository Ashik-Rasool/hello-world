# hello-world
I can sometimes run out of ideas (coder's block?) as I am a human. Probably. And that is why I made this repository so you can suggest ideas for me to try or show off some of your work. Perhaps I can take a page or two from your work and put a new twist on it.
I would greatly appreciate if you contributed. Though I am not forcing you to do so. Thanks!
